to read what Redditers in [r/functionalprint](https://www.reddit.com/r/functionalprint/) said about this design.

## Parts

* 1/2 in. x 10 ft. PVC schedule 40 pipe. (In retrospect, the pipe is too flexible so 3/4 in. could work better.)
* 6x fingers and 1x wrist, 3D printed
* A piece of electric wire for attaching the fingers to the wrist
* 2x pulleys, 2x tees and 2x stoppers, 3D printed
* A cable to drive the pulleys, e.g. unused phone cable
* M3 bolts
* Rubber bands

## Tools

* 3D printer
* PVC pipe cutter or saw
* Screw driver or Allen wrench

## Build the Hand

3D-print the following pieces. Fast print mode is fine since the pieces don't need to be super precise.
* 6x [finger.stl](https://github.com/macroxue/light-bulb-changer/blob/master/finger.stl)
* 1x [wrist.stl](https://github.com/macroxue/light-bulb-changer/blob/master/wrist.stl)

Put the electric wire through the holes of the wrist and tie its ends. Hook the fingers on to the wire.

Cut about one foot of PVC pipe. Insert the pipe to the socket of the wrist and fasten the assembly with two M3 bolts.

Wrap rubber bands tightly to the tips of the fingers. Put one rubber band through all six holes at the tips and tie its two ends.

## Build the Pulley System

3D-print the following pieces.
* 2x [pulley.stl](https://github.com/macroxue/light-bulb-changer/blob/master/pulley.stl)
* 1x [tee.stl](https://github.com/macroxue/light-bulb-changer/blob/master/tee.stl)
* 1x [tee2.stl](https://github.com/macroxue/light-bulb-changer/blob/master/tee2.stl)
* 2x [stopper.stl](https://github.com/macroxue/light-bulb-changer/blob/master/stopper.stl)

Assemble the pulley system according to the 3D animation above. In my case, the pulleys are about 5 feet apart on a pipe of 7 feet.

Rubber bands can be put in the groove of a pulley to add more grip.

## Adjustment

Since the 1/2 in. PVC pipe was too flexible, it's put inside a stainless steel telescoping pipe savaged from an old clothes rack. In retrospect, the steel pipe alone could be sufficient but I didn't want to redesign the 3D-printed parts.

The hand may be attached to the other end of the pipe so it can change light bulbs in the ceiling or on a celling fan. However, it may not work well for light bulbs with a flat bottom as the fingers can't open eaisly when pushed against the bottom.
